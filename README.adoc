NOTE: This is no longer maintained.  Work is in progress to implement a feature
like this directly in ludusavi, check here:
https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/pull/235

IMPORTANT: This will not work with Heroic 2.9

= Ludusavi Launcher

Wrapper script to be used as an intermediate in Heroic for GOG Games.

It determines the game from the command line parameters, restores savegames,
launches the game and does a backup afterwards.

Command line parameters are searched for the gogdl command in a very simply
manner.

== WARNING

This script heavily depends on how Heroic launches a game.

There is no error checking so far.
