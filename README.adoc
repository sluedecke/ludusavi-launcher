= Ludusavi Launcher

Wrapper script to be used as an intermediate in Heroic.

It determines the game from the command line parameters, restores savegames,
launches the game and does a backup afterwards.

== WARNING

This script heavily depends on how Heroic launches a game.  Using mangohud or
gamemode with a game breaks it.

There is no error checking so far.
